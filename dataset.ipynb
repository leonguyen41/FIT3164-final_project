As we \\ndiscussed, everyone has a different dose of lasix required to \\nmake them urinate and it's likely that you weren't taking a high \\nenough dose. Please take these medications daily to keep excess \\nfluid off and eat a low salt diet. You will follow up with Dr. \\n___ in liver clinic and from there have your colonoscopy \\nand EGD scheduled. Of course, we are always here if you need us. \\nWe wish you all the best!\\nYour ___ Team.  \\n \\nFollowup Instructions:\\n___\\n  \n",

She is tired of \"fighting\" her end stage \\nliver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of \\nlife. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice, \\nwhich we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would \\nlike to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the \\npatient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably \\nbe DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP). \\nTherefore, at this time, she remains full code. We also \\ndiscussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter \\nplaced because of her repeated paracenteses.

Cardiac size is \\ntop-normal.  Hilar \\nlymphadenopathy is better evaluated on prior CT.  Port-A-Cath is \\nin standard position.  There is no pneumothorax or large \\neffusions.  Surgical clips in the right axilla are again noted. \\n\\nSINUS CT (___):\\n1. Mucous retention cysts versus polyps in bilateral maxillary \\nsinuses and \\nposterior ethmoid air cells.  Mild mucosal thickening of the \\nsphenoid sinuses bilaterally. \\n2. Stable subcentimeter bilateral parotid gland lymph nodes. \\n\\nCHEST CT W/O CONTRAST (___):\\nInterstitial thickening with small associated bilateral \\neffusions suggest \\npulmonary edema.  No cardiomegaly. No findings to suggest a \\nlower respiratory tract infection/pneumonia. Relative \\nhypodensity of the blood pool suggests anemia. Thyroid \\nultrasound may be performed if clinically indicated for further \\nassessment of the 4 mm hypervascular lesion in the right lobe \\nthyroid as described above. \\n\\nWHOLE BODY PET-CT (___):\\nSince the PET-CT of ___, there has been extensive \\nprogression of disease, as seen on multiple recent CT exams \\n(D5a).  FDG avidity is intense and most pronounced in the \\nbilateral axillary, mediastinal, mesenteric, retroperitoneal, \\npelvic sidewall, and inguinal lymph nodes. \\n\\nPORT US (___):\\n1.  No evidence of a fluid collection or abscess in the region \\nof the anterior chest port. \\n2.  Again seen are multiple hypervascular lymph nodes nearby the \\nport, better visualized on CT chest dated ___. \\n3.  Ultrasound cannot evaluate for port clot.  If clinically \\nindicated, \\nangiographic assessment could be considered to evaluate for port \\npatency. \\n\\nPATHOLOGY:\\n==========\\nPERIPHERAL BLOOD IMMUNOPHENOTYPING (___):\\nFindings are of involvement by a kappa restricted B-cell \\nlymphoproliferative disorder, CD10(+) immunophenotypically \\nconsistent with involvement by the patient's known germinal \\ncenter derived lymphoma. Correlation with clinical and other \\nancillary findings is recommended. \\n\\nBONE MARROW, CORE BIOPSY, PATHOLOGY (___): PENDING\\nBONE MARROW, ASPIRATE, IMMUNOPHENOTYPING (___): PENDING\\nBONE MARROW, ASPIRATE, CYTOGENETIGS (___): PENDING\\n \\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nMrs. ___ is an ___ woman with a past history of \\nfollicular lymphoma with multiple treatment attempts with \\nseveral different agents most recently on Zydelig (d/ced on \\n___ who presented for fever without significant localizing \\nsymptoms or signs, associated with eosinophilia and neutropenia. \\n\\n\\n# Fever:\\nExtensive work-up negative for infection including multiple \\nurine and blood cultures, torso CT scan, fungal markers and \\nserologies/PCR for multiple agents such as EBV, CMV, HHV6, \\nparvovirus, adenovirus, strongyloides, anaplasma, and lyme \\ndisease. The patient was started on broad coverage with \\ncefepime/vancomycin, also got course of levofloxacin (initially \\nto cover for atypical organisms for a presumed HCAP) and \\nivermectin (empirically given low sensitivity of strongyloides \\nserologies). PET-CT and bone marrow biopsy were performed \\nsubsequently and were suggestive of worsening follicular \\nlymphoma. Patient was given 2 doses of dexamethasone 10mg while \\nin hospital with improvement of her fevers without any signs of \\na worsening infection. Patient was afebrile for >48h prior to \\ndischarge. Plan is for outpatient chemotherapy.\\n\\n# Acute Kidney Injury:\\nPatient presented with a creatinine of 1.2, up from a baseline \\nof 0.6.

Her \\ninfectious work up was negative, and fevers resolved with \\ndexamethasone. As part of infectious work up, CT chest was \\nperformed ___, and she was found to have disease progression \\nwith increase in diffuse lymphadenopathy; also seen on CT \\nabdomen/pelvis of ___. She also developed a transaminitis \\ninitially thought either secondary to drug induced liver injury \\nor infiltrative disease, now s/p transcutaneous liver biopsy on \\n___. Final pathology is pending at time of discharge, but her \\nLFTs continue to downtrend and preliminary read is without \\nlymphomatous infiltration of the liver.\\n\\nACUTE ISSUES\\n# Fever: Has had recent admissions for fevers with extensive \\nwork-up negative for infection including multiple urine and \\nblood cultures, torso CT scan, fungal markers and serologies/PCR \\nfor multiple agents such as EBV, CMV, HHV6, parvovirus, \\nadenovirus, strongyloides, anaplasma, and lyme disease. \\nUltimately, PET-CT and bone marrow biopsy were suggestive of \\nworsening follicular lymphoma and fevers were thought due to \\nworsening lymphoma. Patient was given 2 doses of dexamethasone \\n10 mg last admission with improvement of her fevers without any \\nsigns of a worsening\\ninfection. This admission, she again presented with recurrent \\nfevers. Patient was initially started on levofloxacin and \\nvancomycin to cover urinary and common respiratory infections, \\nbut infectious studies were negative and antibiotics quickly \\nstopped. C. diff negative. Her other infectious work up, \\nincluding blood and urine cultures, and imaging, including CT \\nchest, abdomen, pelvis, were negative for infection. Hence \\nantibiotics were discontinued and patient was started on \\ndexamethasone 20 mg IV on ___. She has been afebrile \\nsince. Her steroid was changed to PO prednisone 40 mg daily on \\n___, and will be tapered as follows: 20 mg starting ___, \\nwith intent for further titration as determined by outpatient \\nproviders. \\n\\n# Follicular Lymphoma: Ms. ___ has received multiple \\ntreatments since ___. Most recently, she received obinutuzumab \\n(___). She was originally planned for initiation of \\nbendamustine in clinic, however this was held due to fever. Of \\nnote, there was apparently some consideration for a potential \\nclinical trial with BITE therapy, however patient was excluded \\ndue to reported tetracycline allergy. She was given bendamustine \\n___ and ___ while in house, with close monitoring for tumor \\nlysis, which was not seen after bendamustine therapy.  For \\nprophylaxis, she was continued on atovaquone, and allopurinol \\nwhilst in house. Acyclovir was temporarily held for ___, and \\nthen restarted once resolved. She will require neulasta with Dr. \\n___ on ___.\\n\\n# Acute Kidney Injury: Creatinine of 1.3 on admission, up from a \\nbaseline of 0.6-0.7. At this time, most likely pre-renal \\nsecondary to volume depletion due to fevers and poor appetite. \\nRenal ultrasound did not demonstrate obstruction, U/A without \\nUTI. She had been on obinutuzumab which has been shown to \\ndecrease creatinine clearance in up to 60% of patients which \\ncould be contributing. However, in the setting of hypocalcemia,  \\nhyperphosphatemia, and recent chemotherapy, we were initially \\nconcerned for tumor lysis syndrome and followed tumor lysis \\nlabs. She did receive 1 dose of rasburicase on ___ despite uric \\nacid only 6.1. Ultimately, this resolved with mIVF and on \\ndischarge her creatinine was 0.7. Of note, her acyclovir was \\ntemporarily held in setting of ___.\\n\\n# Transaminitis: Patient was noted to have transaminitis during \\nstay with peak ALT/AST 230s/500s, concerning for hepatocellular \\ninjury. CT abdomen/pelvis, RUQ US, and MRI abdomen without clear \\nstructural hepatic abnormality. She was seen by hepatology, who \\nfelt that liver injury could be related to medications including \\nobinutuzumab, tylenol and rasburicase, or infiltrative disease. \\nAll potentially offending medications were held, she was started \\non steroids as above, and her LFTs have been downtrending since \\n___. She is s/p transcutaneous liver biopsy with ___ on \\n___ to better clarify the etiology of transaminitis; final \\npathology is pending at time of discharge. However preliminary \\nread is: no involvement by follicular lymphoma. Mild hepatocyte \\napoptosis, which is non-specific. Normal bile ducts, no vascular \\ninjury, no fatty change. No viral cytopathic process. Values had \\ntrended to near normal by time of discharge. Hepatology \\nrecommends follow up LFT within two weeks of discharge\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\\n# Patient discharged on 20 mg prednisone, please determine \\ncourse/taper as an outpatient\\n# Patient with appointment for neulasta on ___\\n# Further chemotherapy plan per outpatient oncologist Dr. \\n___ up appointment scheduled for ___\\n# Please draw LFT within two weeks of discharge to ensure they \\nare trending down\\n# Please follow up with final pathology of liver biopsy\\n# Discharge Hb: 7.4, creatinine 0.7 \\n\\n# Code: Full, confirmed\\n# Contact: HCP: ___ (daughter/HCP) ___ \\n___\\n\\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\\n1.

(___) admitted \\nfrom the ED with fevers and rigors.\\n\\nPatient was in her usual state of health until receiving C2D1 \\nbendamustine infusion in clinic. The infusion went well, but on \\nher way home she developed shaking chills. She went to bed, but \\nthe chills progressed so she called her oncologist office. She \\nwas advised to take 25mg po bendaryl and report to the ED. At \\nthe time, she had no fever, and no \\npain/palpitations/dyspnea/lip/tongue swelling. NO abd pain or \\nnausea/vomiting.\\n\\nOf note, her bendamustine is being dose reduced as she has had \\nsignificant pancytopenia in the past. She also recently finished \\na prednisone taper, which was started last hospitalization due \\nto fevers thought due to her recurrent lymphoma. Note that \\nduring the last hospitalization from ___ she had fevers \\nat the time of that admission as high as 103, and no infectious \\nsource was found. She did have a liver biopsy that admission due \\nto drug induced liver injury. \\n\\nIn the ED, initial VS were T 102.9, HR 148, BP 188/65, RR 18, O2 \\n99%RA. Patient defevervesced to 98.6 and HR improved to 104. BP \\nto 92/42. Initial labs notable for WBC 3.5 (ANC 2240), HCT 26.1, \\nPLT 90, Na 135, K 4.6, HCO3 19, Cr 0.8. Na 135, K 4.6, HCO3 19, \\nCr 0.8, ALT 51, ALT 35, ALP 161, TBili 0.4, lipase 71. Lactate \\n2.1, flu PCR swab negative, UA negative. CXR showed left basilar \\nopacity c/f PNA vs atelectasis. Patient was given ~4L NS, IV \\nvancomycin and zosyn, Tylenol, and atovaquone prior to admission \\nfor further management. BP was 100/51 prior to transfer. Repeat \\nlactate was 2.5. On arrival to the floor, patient has no acute \\ncomplaint. Denies headache or visual changes. No sore throat or \\nrhinitis. No CP or palpitations. She has had a mild \\nnon-productive cough that started earlier in the day. No SOB. No \\nN/V or diarrhea. Normal BM day of admission. No dysuria.

At the time of diagnosis of her breast cancer, she had a\\nright axillary node dissection and pathology actually showed\\nnon-Hodgkin's follicular lymphoma grade ___.  \\n\\nTREATMENT HISTORY:\\n- ___ - ___ Fludarabine and Rituxan \\n- ___, Recurrence of disease. \\n- Rituxan x4 cycles, complicated by shingles. \\n- ___, PET-CT showed changes concerning for \\nprogression and a biopsy showing follicular lymphoma. \\n- ___ Bone marrow biopsy in ___ showed no evidence \\nof lymphoma. \\n- ___ PET-CT again showed increased adenopathy, at which \\ntime she moved forward with Zevalin therapy. \\n- ___ Her disease again progressed, and right inguinal \\nbiopsy showed follicular lymphoma. She was treated with \\nbendamustine at that time. \\n- ___ she again palpated another left inguinal node, \\nand CT scan on ___, showed new extensive multifocal \\nadenopathy in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. She underwent \\nadditional biopsy of the left inguinal node, which showed \\nrecurrence of follicular lymphoma, immunoreactive for PAX-5, \\nCD20, CD10, Bcl-2, and a variable Bcl-6. \\n- ___ Bone marrow showed cytogenetic abnormalities \\nincluding Bcl-2/IGH translocation consistent with follicular \\nlymphoma. Incidentally, it did show deletion 13, which can be \\nindicative of MDS, although since that time, her blood counts \\nhave been stable. \\n- ___ She completed two cycles of bendamustine and \\nRituxan, with repeat PET CT showing no evidence of disease. \\nFollow up bone marrow did show correction of the IGH \\ntranslocation, it did continue to show a 13q deletion with no \\nsigns of lymphoma or MDS in the marrow. She continued with \\nRituxan maintenance every three months. \\n- ___ She underwent restaging CTs after palpating \\nsome cervical adenopathy.

She remained afebrile and asymptomatic throughout \\nhospital course and was discharged with outpatient follow-up.\\n\\n# Fever: Multiple recent admissions for fever, infectious workup \\nultimately negative and thought due to worsening lymphoma. For \\nthis hospitalization differential included recurrent tumor fever \\ngiven recently completed prednisone taper, drug effect secondary \\nto bendamustine, infection.  Initial infectious work-up was \\nunremarkable other than small area of atelectasis or \\nconsolidation in left lower lobe. Vancomycin and cefepime were \\ngivne for three days and then patient was transitioned to oral \\nlevaquin.  She received a second dose of bendamustine with \\nTylenol, Benadryl and dexamethasone premedication. \\n\\n# Follicular Lymphoma: Refractory through multiple treatments \\nsince ___. Recently started bendamustine. Tolerated C1 well. \\nReceived C2D1 on day of admission in clinic. Previously has had \\nsome consideration for a potential clinical trial with BITE \\ntherapy, however patient was excluded  due to reported \\ntetracycline allergy. Received neulasta support with \\nbendamustine after C1. Continued acyclovir, atovaquone, and \\nallopurinol prophylaxis.  Will consider outpatient neupogen \\ntreatment. \\n\\n# Elevated lactate: Up to 2.5 with slightly low HCO3 and AG of \\n17.

Rituxan who is admitted for \\nchemotherapy. \\n\\nHer last dose of chemo was ___. Repeat scans afterwards\\nshowed resolution of lymphadenopathy in the chest, abdomen, and\\npelvis but large nodes in the neck were noted. Biopsy of the\\nnodes showed transformed lymphoma. She is admitted now for \\nEPOCH.\\n\\nOtherwise she feels well. No fevers or chills. No chest pain,\\ncough, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,\\nchange in bowels. She was noted to have some lower extremity\\nedema recently. A TTE was performed which showed EF of 50-55%.\\nEdema has since resolved. \\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  A 10 point review of systems was performed\\nand negative except as noted in the HPI. \\n \\n\\n \\nPast Medical History:\\nPAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  \\nInitially felt a breast lump -> DCIS s/p right mastectomy (ER/PR \\npositive, no sentinel nodes had breast cancer). \\nSentinal notes (3 of 8) did have NHL -> follicular lymphoma \\nstage IIIa ___ Fludarabine and Rituxan\\n- ___, Recurrence of disease. \\n- Rituxan x4 cycles, complicated by shingles.  \\n- ___, PET-CT showed changes concerning for \\nprogression\\nand a biopsy showing follicular lymphoma.  \\n- ___ Bone marrow biopsy in ___ showed no evidence\\nof lymphoma.  \\n- ___ PET-CT again showed increased adenopathy, at which\\ntime she moved forward with Zevalin therapy.  \\n-___ Her disease again progressed, and right inguinal \\nbiopsy\\nshowed follicular lymphoma.  She was treated with bendamustine \\nat\\nthat time.  \\n- ___ she again palpated another left inguinal node, \\nand\\nCT scan on ___, showed new extensive multifocal\\nadenopathy in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  She underwent\\nadditional biopsy of the left inguinal node, which showed\\nrecurrence of follicular lymphoma, immunoreactive for PAX-5,\\nCD20, CD10, Bcl-2, and a variable Bcl-6.  \\n-___ Bone marrow showed cytogenetic abnormalities \\nincluding\\nBcl-2/IGH translocation consistent with follicular lymphoma. \\nIncidentally, it did show deletion 13, which can be indicative \\nof\\nMDS, although since that time, her blood counts have been \\nstable.\\n-___ - ___ She completed two cycles of bendamustine and\\nRituxan, with repeat PET CT showing no evidence of disease. \\nFollow up bone marrow did show correction of the IGH\\ntranslocation, it did continue to show a 13q deletion with no\\nsigns of lymphoma or MDS in the marrow.

A \\nbiopsy showed a more aggressive lymphoma for which she was \\nadmitted for ___. \\n\\nInitially, her submandibular gland swelling was large enough to \\nraise a concern for a potential airway compromise if it were to \\nprogress. Pt tolerated EPOCH, SM swelling improved, no signs of \\ntumor lysis. Pt w/mildly elevated LFTs and BPs over admission, \\nthought ___ EPOCH & IVF, HTN Tx w/low dose Nifedipine \\ntemporarily. Pt's ___ 480 on DC, was started on Cipro 500mg bid \\nfor ppx.\\n\\n#Follicular lymphoma with recent clonal transformation\\nPatient has a long history of follicular lymphoma and over the \\nlast ___ years has undergone numerous treatments.  Most recently \\nshe was on a combination of bendamustine and rituxan with good \\nresponse overall, but developed sudden submandibular gland \\nswelling, which showed clonal transformation.  Given the concern \\nfor eventual airway compromise, she was admitted for EPOCH \\nchemotherapy, which she tolerated very well (other than a small \\nrise in her ALT and elevated blood pressure).  She has a very \\nhigh functional status and frequently walked around the halls at \\na brisk pace.  At the time of discharge, her painful \\nsubmandibular fullness has almost fully resolved.  She will \\ncontinue to follow with Dr. ___ further treatment plan. \\n\\n#Elevated blood pressure \\nPatient developed an elevated blood pressure without any signs \\nor symptoms of end organ damage.  There was some associated \\npedal edema.  We felt this was all likely related to her steroid \\ncomponent of the chemotherapy, and given the lack of symptoms \\nfrom her elevated blood pressure and limited steroid duration, \\nwe decided not to treat.  She will have blood pressure follow up \\nas an outpatient. \\n\\n#Pancytopenia \\nLikely related to chemotherapy.  patient was neutropenic with an \\nANC of 480 at the time of discharge.  She will take preventative \\nCipro at discharge and receive Neulasta later in the week.  She \\ndid not need any transfusion support. She was counseled about \\nthe need to present immediately to the ED should she develop \\nfever at home given neutropenia; she and her partner articulated \\ntheir understanding and agreement.\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n===================\\n#NEW MEDS: Neulasta ___ clinic), Ondansetron prn, Cipro 500mg \\nBID\\n\\n#Pt to start Neulasta in clinic on ___ for count recovery, \\nand will f/u with Dr ___ continued ___\\n#Pt started on Cipro 500mg BID for PPX, ANC 480 on DC.
